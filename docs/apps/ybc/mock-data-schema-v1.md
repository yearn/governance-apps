# YBC Mock Data Schema v1

Purpose: a stable mock data contract for design, prototypes, and mock-backed
implementation. The canonical TypeScript mirror lives in
`lib/clients/ybc/types.ts`.

## Type Shape

```ts
import type { Address } from "viem";

type UnixSeconds = number;
type YbcAmount = string;

type YbcMockExampleScenariosV1 = {
  version: 1;
  generatedAt: UnixSeconds;
  scenarios: YbcMockScenario[];
};

type YbcMockScenario = {
  id: "observer" | "member-matured" | "member-ramping" | "operator-admin";
  label: string;
  data: YbcMockDataV1;
};

type YbcMockDataV1 = {
  version: 1;
  generatedAt: UnixSeconds;
  asOf: UnixSeconds;
  epoch: {
    current: number;
    startsAt: UnixSeconds;
    endsAt: UnixSeconds;
  };
  hero: YbcHeroRecord;
  me: YbcAccountPerspective;
  roster: YbcRosterRecord;
  proposals: YbcProposalBoardRecord;
  rewards: YbcRewardsRecord;
  admin?: YbcAdminRecord;

};

type YbcRewardPeriod = {

## Field Rules

- All timestamps are Unix seconds.
- `generatedAt` is when a fixture was produced. `asOf` is the effective data
  time used for proposal action and phase examples.
- Token amounts and weights are decimal strings to preserve precision in JSON.
- `hero.internalWeight` is the collective effective member weight, not raw stake.
- `hero.totalInfluence` is `internalWeight + delegatedWeight` in display units.
- Raw stake, effective weight, and target weight must remain separate fields on
  `me`, roster totals, and every roster member.
- `maturityBps` is `0` to `10000`. `maturesAt` is `null` for fully matured or
  non-member perspectives.
- `targetWeight` can exceed `effectiveWeight` while a member is ramping.
- Proposal phases are explicit; UI should not infer phase from timestamps alone.
- `awaiting-execution` means the vote passed and execution is open but not yet
  completed.
- `expired`, `executed`, `failed`, and `retracted` proposals are terminal.
- Expired proposals remain visible but have no enabled actions. A user must
  start a new proposal instead of reviving the expired one.
- YBC rewards are visible in this surface, but `rewards.claim.mode` must remain
  `shared-claim-surface`; MVP must not model a separate isolated YBC claim page.
- Admin operations are limited to `add-member` and `remove-member`. The schema
  intentionally does not expose a generic arbitrary-call operation.

## Required Scenario Coverage

`mock-data.example.json` should include:

- observer, not a member
- member with fully matured weight
- member with ramping weight
- operator/admin view

Across those scenarios, proposal fixtures should cover:

- discussion
- voting
- awaiting execution
- executed terminal state
- expired terminal state

The scenario set is the source of truth for WP1 design and mock-backed prototype
work until onchain reads supersede the mock contract in a later work package.
