# veYFI UI Spec v1.1

**Status:** Implemented (Phase 6 Complete)
**Applies to:** `veyfi.yearn.fi` (and `/veyfi` route)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-11

---

## 1. Scope & Purpose

This document defines the **UI and interaction model** for `veyfi.yearn.fi`.
Unlike the single-asset dashboard of stYFI, this is a **Registry & Management Tool** for multiple assets:

- **Migration:** Moving legacy veYFI to the new system.
- **LLYFI Registry:** Managing multiple Liquid Locker tokens (sdYFI, upYFI, etc.).
- **Redemption:** Monitoring liquidity caps and exiting LLYFI positions.

---

## 2. Design Principles

1.  **Registry Pattern:** We do not assume a single "primary" balance. Users scan a list of supported tokens to find their positions.
2.  **Intelligence First:** Redemption is cap-constrained. We show "Global Availability" (Flight Board) _before_ the user tries to transact.
3.  **Hub & Spoke Rewards:** All yield is realized in the stYFI Dashboard. This page only directs users there; it does not duplicate claiming logic.
4.  **Explicit Exit logic:** "Buying" and "Selling" LLYFI is handled within the token's specific context, keeping cap/fee logic tightly coupled to the asset.

---

## 3. Information Architecture

**Route:** `/veyfi`

**Page Structure:**

1.  **Global Header** (Standard Yearn Header)
2.  **Protocol Stats Bar** (Ecosystem Health)
3.  **Migration Zone** (Top priority, conditionally visible)
4.  **LLYFI Ledger** (Main management table)
5.  **Redemption Intelligence** (Global liquidity context)
6.  **Rewards Navigation** (Footer/Link)

---

## 4. Layout Zones

### 4.1 Protocol Stats Bar

**Purpose:** Display ecosystem health metrics.
**Content:**

- **Migrated veYFI:** Total amount + % of legacy supply migrated.
- **Current Boost:** The current max multiplier (e.g., "1.52x") for legacy locks.
- **Total Staked:** % of LLYFI supply currently staked in the protocol.
- **State:** Optional system phase from MOTD JSON (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTD_URL`). Omit if missing/invalid.

### 4.2 Zone 1: Migration

**Component:** `MigrationCard`
**States:**

- **Action (Legacy Balance > 0):** "You have X legacy veYFI. Migrate now." (Primary CTA).
- **Info (Migrated):** "veYFI Boost Active". Visualizes the linear decay of the boost multiplier (2.0x -> 1.0x) over time.
  - User boost display should be derived from account lock data: `1 + max(0, boost_epochs - current_epoch) / 104`.
  - `boost_epochs` comes from `VotingEscrowRewardDistributor.locks(address)` and reflects the user-specific migrated boost schedule.

### 4.3 Zone 2: The LLYFI Ledger

**Component:** `LlyfiTokenTable`
**Structure:**

- **Header:** Asset | Locker Status | Staked Ratio | Effective APR | Staked Balance.
- During **epoch 0** (canonical clock), the APR column label switches to **Next Epoch APR** and uses projected APR inputs.
- **Rows:** Expandable (Accordion).
- **Expanded State (Cockpit):** Reveals the "Manage" interface for that specific token.
- **Data sources (pre-connect):**
  - Locker Status uses `global.veyfi.tokens[].redemption.capacity` (YFI locked).
- Effective APR uses `llyfi[].current.aprBps` (or `projected.aprBps` when `epoch == 0`).
- Base stYFI APR uses `styfi.current.aprBps` (or `styfi.projected.aprBps` when `epoch == 0`), matching the migration card.
- veYFI migrated-lock boost uses user-specific `boost_epochs` from account lock data with canonical `current_epoch`; do not substitute global max boost values.
- The APR tooltip shows base stYFI APR, boost multiplier, and the LLYFI staked ratio derived from `llyfi[].staked + llyfi[].unstaking` over capacity.

**The Cockpit (Tabs):**

1.  **Stake:**
    - Approve -> Stake flow.
2.  **Unstake:**
    - **Linear Streaming UI:** Reuses the "Pink" progress bar logic from stYFI.
    - **Header:** Labeled "Cooldown Status" to reflect state-based accounting (avoids confusion when bar resets after withdrawal).
    - Withdraw available liquid funds (read from `maxWithdraw` and normalized to Assets).
3.  **Trade:**
    - **Mode Selection:** Radio Button (Sell vs Buy).
    - **Buy (YFI -> LLYFI):**
      - **Constraint:** Limited by `Redemption.inventory` (Amount of LLYFI held by protocol).
      - **Contract:** `exchange()`.
    - **Sell (LLYFI -> YFI):**
      - **Action:** Labeled "Sell [Token]" (e.g. Sell sdYFI).
      - **Constraint:** Limited by `Redemption.capacity - Redemption.used` AND `Redemption.YFI_Balance`.
      - **Fee:** Shows exit fee (bps) and Net Receive amount.
      - **Contract:** `redeem()`.
4.  **Info:**
    - Read-only contract references for the selected locker.
    - Displays LLYFI token contract, locker depositor contract, and global redemption facility.
    - Address links use the shared `ContractLink` primitive (truncated code format + Etherscan link).

### 4.4 Zone 3: Redemption Intelligence & Rewards

**Component:** `InventoryCard` ("Flight Board")
**Purpose:** Inform the user about exit liquidity _before_ they dig into specific tokens.
**Content:**

- **Global Inventory:** Table of available YFI held by protocol.
- **Current Fee:** The current exit fee (e.g., "5.0%").
- **Asset breakdown:** Read-only list showing YFI available per token type.

**Component:** `VeyfiRewardsCard`
**Purpose:** Reinforce stYFI as the yield hub.
**Content:** "Rewards are aggregated in the stYFI ecosystem."
**Action:** "Go to stYFI Dashboard".

**Component:** `ContractsFooter`
**Purpose:** Keep global contract references discoverable without adding cockpit clutter.
**Content:** Legacy veYFI contract, reward distributor, and global redemption facility with Etherscan links.

## 5. Data Requirements

### 5.1 New Global Stats

The frontend requires a new `getGlobalStats()` method from the VeyfiClient to populate the top bar:

- `migratedYfi` (bigint)
- `lockedYfi` (bigint)
- `maxBoostMultiplier` (number/bigint, e.g. 15200 bps)
- `totalLlyfiStakedPercent` (number/bigint bps)

### 5.2 Token Data

- `LlyfiTokenState` must include `address` for approvals.
- APY data must include `base` vs `boost` breakdown if possible (or aggregated Net APY).

---

## 6. Copy & Tone

- **Migration:** Urgent but helpful. "Don't lose your boost."
- **Redemption:** Transparent. "Subject to dynamic exit fee."
- **Colors:**
  - **veYFI/LLYFI:** "Disco Salmon" (#CC3767).
  - **Warnings/Caps:** Amber/Red if caps are near full.

---

## 7. Cross-App Nudge

- **Goal:** Contextual guidance to `/styfi` only when an immediate stake action is available.
- **Trigger policy:** Show at most one nudge for high-intent action:
  - unstaked YFI in wallet
  - intentionally **does not** show claim/manage-only nudges to reduce banner fatigue
- **Connection gating:** Nudge evaluation requires an actual connected wallet (`wagmi` connected), not only mock fallback identity.
- **Data path:** veYFI uses a lightweight stYFI nudge read (`getNudgeState`) instead of full stYFI page-state hydration.
  - Includes only: YFI wallet balance + minimal stake-state signals.
  - Excludes: allowances, cockpit tab state, and full rewards card derivations.
- **Copy source:** All nudge copy is defined in shared message config (`app/_shared/messages.ts`), not hardcoded in hook logic.
- **Amount formatting:** token values use standard token formatting with 4 decimal precision.
- **Visual treatment:** Brand-tinted banner with row-collapse animation (no fixed mobile `min-height`) and top-right dismiss action.
- **Dismiss behavior:** `X` only; dismissal snoozes for 7 days per wallet and nudge ID.
- **CTA behavior:**
  - Label: "Visit stYFI website"
  - Opens in a new tab with external-link icon
  - Hostname-aware routing via governance link resolver:
    - `localhost` / `app.dao-ops.com` -> path-scoped `/styfi`
    - `*-beta.dao-ops.com` -> canonical `https://styfi-beta.dao-ops.com`
    - `*.yearn.fi` -> canonical `https://styfi.yearn.fi`
- **Deep-link behavior:** CTA routes include `source=nudge` + focus/action params.
- **Scroll reliability:** Deep-link scroll waits for DOM target readiness via `MutationObserver` instead of fixed timers.
