# DAO Governance Delivery Plan

Current entry points: [production handoff](production-release-20261001.md), [production procedure](../production-release.md), and [delivery status](status.md).
The [UAT closeout](uat-closeout-20260930.md) and [preprod preparation](../preprod-validation.md) retain completed-stage evidence.
The dated sequencing below records the historical delivery plan.

Status (2026-09-10): the accepted mock UI and reviewed V2 reads are integrated. The producer is reported released and active.

Use the [milestone plan](milestone-plan.md) as the single active delivery plan. [Status](status.md) separates inspected evidence from user-reported facts.
Older package ordering and producer-start gates are superseded. WP13–WP17 retain acceptance requirements within the combined live package.

## Branches and worktrees

```text
integration branch:   agent/integration
integration worktree: ../governance-apps.agent.integration

package branch:       agent/dao/<milestone>/<wp>
package worktree:     ../governance-apps.dao.<milestone>.<wp>
```

Example:

```fish
cd /Users/hydra/Developer/yearn/governance-apps.agent.integration
./scripts/workpkg-worktree.sh create \
  --track dao \
  --milestone m1 \
  --wp wp1 \
  --base agent/integration \
  --install
```

The authorized combined package is `agent/dao/m5/live`, based on `28dd8fff2e7ff00961174635715be8d18ecd8d42`.

## Current sequence

The [milestone plan](milestone-plan.md) defines implementation, lightweight fork UAT, independent review, and separate release reconciliation/rollout.
No intermediate package approvals are required within the authorized implementation.
Historical M2 product gates, manual fork UAT, and Pinata acceptance are complete. The operator reports successful preprod deployment and two proposals.
Independent production candidate review and the ordered operator procedure remain before release.

## Agent workflow

When explicitly authorized to orchestrate independent agents, use the existing workflow. External review of the current consumer is complete and recorded by the integrator from the user-supplied approval. For future packages, the implementer must not mark its own external review complete or merge its own branch:

1. Assign one implementer as the only editing owner of a package worktree.
2. Require a focused Conventional Commit and clean status.
3. Assign an independent reviewer read-only.
4. Assign the package's specialist auditor read-only.
5. Assign a fixer in the same package worktree for accepted blockers.
6. Re-run review against the final commit range.
7. Assign an integrator to merge the approved branch with `--no-ff`.
8. Run post-merge checks in the integration worktree.

Never let two agents edit one worktree. Do not ask a reviewer to fix what they
find. Do not merge uncommitted work or a branch whose reviewed SHA has changed
without re-review.
