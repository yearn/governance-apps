# DAO Governance Delivery Plan

Status: M2 WP7A implementation and evidence complete; renewed user acceptance
is next.

This plan is the task source for implementing DAO Governance. It uses the shared
workflow in [`docs/shared/codex-usage-guide.md`](../../../shared/codex-usage-guide.md)
and the product sources one directory above.

## Delivery gates

| Milestone | Outcome | Human gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Canonical requirements, tooling, and handoff | Accepted in discovery |
| M1 | Domain model, routes, and shared debug runtime | Engineering review |
| M2 | Complete mock proposal, voting, authoring, and UX | User accepts mock UX |
| M3 | Feed contract, fixture-backed producer, and staging contract validation | Producer and consumer accept schema |
| M4 | Feed-backed reads and analysis presentation | Read-path review |
| M5 | Forum/IPFS publication and onchain writes | Write/security review |
| M6 | Fork deployment and full lifecycle proof | User accepts fork UAT |
| M7 | Preproduction and controlled production rollout | Explicit production approval |

Do not start M3 before the user accepts M2. Do not start M7 before fork evidence
is accepted.

## Branches and worktrees

```text
integration branch:   agent/integration
integration worktree: ../governance-apps.agent.integration

package branch:       agent/dao/<milestone>/<wp>
package worktree:     ../governance-apps.dao.<milestone>.<wp>
```

Example:

```fish
cd /Users/hydra/Developer/yearn/governance-apps.agent.integration
./scripts/workpkg-worktree.sh create \
  --track dao \
  --milestone m1 \
  --wp wp1 \
  --base agent/integration \
  --install
```

Create a package only after its dependencies are merged into integration.

## Integration sequence

```text
M1: WP1 -> WP2 -> WP3
M2: WP4 -> WP6 -> WP5 -> WP7 -> user gate -> WP7A when changes are returned -> user gate
M3: WP8 -> WP9 (gov-apps-stats) -> WP10
M4: WP11 -> WP12
M5: WP13 -> WP14 -> WP15
M6: WP16 -> WP17 -> user gate
M7: WP18 -> production approval
```

WP4 and WP6 may run in parallel after M1 if they keep their owned files separate.
Producer WP9 runs in the `gov-apps-stats` repository and its own integration lane.

## Human-gate iteration

User feedback at M2 creates a follow-up package from the latest integration head:
`M2-WP7A`, then `M2-WP7B` if needed. Add the scoped package file before editing,
then run the normal implementation, review, audit, fix, re-review, and integration
loop. Present the gate again after each accepted follow-up. Do not tag M2 or begin
M3 without explicit acceptance.

Use the same suffix pattern after fork UAT (`M6-WP17A`, `M6-WP17B`). Do not tag
M6 or begin rollout until the fork gate is accepted.

## Agent workflow

The root orchestrator uses up to three sub-agents alongside itself:

1. Assign one implementer as the only editing owner of a package worktree.
2. Require a focused Conventional Commit and clean status.
3. Assign an independent reviewer read-only.
4. Assign the package's specialist auditor read-only.
5. Assign a fixer in the same package worktree for accepted blockers.
6. Re-run review against the final commit range.
7. Assign an integrator to merge the approved branch with `--no-ff`.
8. Run post-merge checks in the integration worktree.

Never let two agents edit one worktree. Do not ask a reviewer to fix what they
find. Do not merge uncommitted work or a branch whose reviewed SHA has changed
without re-review.
