# DAO Governance Functional Requirements

## 1. Goal

DAO Governance lets users find Yearn proposals, review their immutable content
and onchain actions, vote, create proposals, and perform permitted lifecycle
actions without hiding the contract's timing or trust boundaries.

The accepted mock product is preserved. Feed V2 reads, live wallet overlays, publication, authoring, and writes are implemented.
[Publication acceptance](publication-acceptance-20260923.md) is complete. Production rollout remains separately approved.
Implementation-phase sequencing below is historical; the [current milestone plan](delivery/milestone-plan.md) controls remaining release work.

## 2. Roles

- Observer: browses proposals without a wallet.
- Voter: reviews current weight and submits one Yea or Nay vote.
- Proposer: meets the live weight, cooldown, and blacklist rules and creates a
  signal or executable proposal.
- Proposal author: retracts their own no-vote proposal when the contract permits.
- Execution caller: submits an approved script when execution is permissionless
  or the account is the guarded operator.
- Operator: flags a malformed no-vote proposal and may execute when guard mode
  requires it.
- Guardian: vetoes a proposal before execution.

A wallet can have more than one role. The UI derives permissions from live facts;
it does not grant authority based on labels from the feed.

## 3. Launch scope

### Included

These are overall product requirements. The combined implementation preserves mock action flows and completes live application behavior under the milestone plan.

- proposal directory and filtering;
- proposal detail, immutable content, forum discussion, vote totals, timeline,
  threshold, and technical metadata;
- wallet voting weight and effective late-vote weight;
- one Yea or Nay vote through the configured Voter;
- post-veto participation voting when the contract still accepts it;
- signal and executable proposal creation;
- full Executor-script hex input with structural browser checks;
- proposer retraction;
- execution review and execution when eligible;
- flag and veto reason display;
- role-gated flag and veto controls in mock and fork coverage;
- content, script and feed failure states, plus fresh transaction-preflight failures;
- shared debug controls and deterministic time travel;
- path-first and feature-gated rollout.

### Not included in the first production scope

- comments or discussion hosted in the app;
- automatic creation of a forum topic;
- a generic ABI transaction builder;
- an importable execution-bundle format;
- arbitrary proposer-supplied ABIs treated as verified;
- changing a submitted vote through the public Voter;
- historical Snapshot proposal ingestion;
- vote-boost claiming, which belongs to the existing reward flow;
- automatic execution;
- automatic network switching.

## 4. Proposal discovery

### DAO-FR-001: public list

`/dao` renders proposal history without requiring a wallet. Each list item shows:

- title and numeric ID;
- signal or executable type;
- display status;
- proposal author;
- vote timing or terminal time;
- Yea/Nay percentages of votes cast;
- a quiet indication when a proposal has executable actions;
- verified discussion availability or its absence.

Each item has one stretched native proposal link so the full row is the primary
target. Nested address explorer and copy controls remain independent. Proposal
links carry the selected source group for contextual detail navigation.

### DAO-FR-002: filters

The list orders `Upcoming`, `Active`, and `Closed`. A valid `?group=` selection
wins even when empty. Otherwise it defaults to populated `Active`, then
`Upcoming`, then `Closed`, and finally `Active` when all are empty. Filtering
uses domain-provided display groups, not duplicate status math in the component.
Selection replaces URL state without growing history. Reload and browser Back
preserve the board group. Detail breadcrumbs use
`Proposals / <Group> / <proposal title>` and reject invalid origin values.

### DAO-FR-003: stable identity

Internal identity always includes chain ID and Voting contract address. Routes
may use the numeric ID while one active contract is unambiguous, but clients,
queries, feeds, and analytics must not.

### DAO-FR-004: unavailable content

Missing or invalid IPFS content does not hide the onchain proposal. The list and
detail page render the available onchain record and identify the content failure.

## 5. Proposal detail

### DAO-FR-010: proposal record

The detail page separates:

- immutable proposal content;
- live or indexed onchain state;
- connected-wallet state;
- exact scripts and supported frontend framing;
- unverified proposer descriptions.

### DAO-FR-011: lifecycle

The page presents raw lifecycle status, community vote result, moderation, and
execution as separate facts. It must represent retracted, flagged, vetoed,
rejected, expired, and executed outcomes without forcing them into a single
happy-path timeline. Flagged proposals have no community result. Stored retracted state and current
timing explain whether a vetoed proposal can still accept participation votes;
do not infer its historical phase from later totals.

### DAO-FR-012: stored threshold and snapshot-effective rules

Show the threshold stored on the proposal, separately from the current default threshold and configuration effective at the displayed snapshot. Voting duration, execution delay/guard and contract identities describe that snapshot, not “rules at creation.” Historical facts come only from retained canonical events. No proposal-time or event-time configuration reconstruction is required.

Governance has no quorum. Passing requires positive total weight and the stored integer-bps threshold. Results say “of votes cast.” The Rules surface remains secondary and collapsed. Configuration changes must not overwrite the stored proposal threshold.

### DAO-FR-013: signal display

A passed empty-script proposal displays:

- type `Signal`;
- status `Approved`;
- `No executable actions`.

The technical disclosure may show the raw contract status.

### DAO-FR-014: exact scripts and optional local decoding

Keep exact script bytes, stored hash and an explicit integrity state. Frame calls with the existing frontend checker only for app-supported Executor implementations. Unknown targets/selectors show raw targets, selectors and calldata. A small reviewed local ABI set may enrich this later; no arbitrary ABI discovery, public implementation proof or producer decoding is required. Proposer descriptions remain separate from byte interpretation.

### DAO-FR-015: canonical timeline and truthful identities

Show canonical block time and transaction/log identity for Propose, Vote, Retract, Flag, Veto and Execute. Propose proposer, Vote account and Execute execution caller use their ABI-defined meaning. Flag/Veto and Retract actors remain unknown; current roles and transaction sender cannot identify immediate historical callers. Preserve zero Vote accounts/weights and all replacement events. Required missing log coverage prevents producer publication.

### DAO-FR-016: execution integrity readiness

The client derives proposal type from the stored script hash: Signal iff it is
`keccak256(0x)`, otherwise Executable, even when event bytes are unavailable.
Signal proposals are not applicable to execution readiness. Executable
proposals are integrity-ready when the exact retained event bytes hash to the
stored value. Missing bytes and a hash mismatch are the only hard integrity
blockers; content `proposalType` never overrides the stored hash.

Board and detail show `Execution blocked` before status and type, followed by a
static reason. They do not infer this badge from lifecycle, moderation, guard,
schedule, account, or simulation state. Detail retains the lower live integrity
explanation, and the board omits `Executable actions` only for a hard blocker.

## 6. Voting

### DAO-FR-020: eligibility

The client supplies `canVote` and a reason when false. The UI does not infer
eligibility from display status alone.

### DAO-FR-021: weight

Before confirmation, show the estimated effective weight for the current time.
When late-vote decay applies, show the original weight, effective weight, and a
short explanation. Dynamic weight and countdown values use tabular numerals.

### DAO-FR-022: direction

The user explicitly chooses Yea or Nay. The app never defaults a vote direction
and never replaces the two choices with a directionless participation button.

### DAO-FR-023: one vote

After a successful public-Voter submission, the account cannot vote again on the
proposal. Feed lag may show a pending indexed state, but the live voted read is
authoritative for blocking a duplicate submission.

### DAO-FR-024: post-veto participation

A vetoed proposal can accept votes when stored retracted=false and current wallet/timing conditions permit. Do not require a positive later total or infer historical veto phase from it. Explain that participation cannot permit approval or execution. Veto with total zero at the event sets retracted=true and blocks voting.

### DAO-FR-025: content failure

Voting remains available when the protocol permits it even if content or
analysis is unavailable. The app requires an explicit confirmation that the
full proposal could not be reviewed.

### DAO-FR-026: raw vote records without mandatory classification

Preserve the raw Vote account, weight and yea bps, including zero values. Later contributions can replace earlier ones; current totals come from stored proposal state. Remove launch requirements for traces, historical caller classification, human/YBC/stYFIx labels and precise human-voter counts. Unknown identity stays unknown.

## 7. Proposal creation

### DAO-FR-029: author eligibility

The client supplies `canPropose`, one primary blocked reason, current and minimum
weight, blacklist state, last proposal time, next eligible time, expected voting
epoch, and the current proposal count for each of the six affected reward
epochs. Proposal capacity is shared across all authors and is full if any
affected epoch already contains 64 proposals.

Normal UI shows the expected voting epoch and one `Affected reward epochs
N–N+5` range, not six capacity rows or a success notice. The six epoch counts
remain available to domain logic and debug tooling. Only a capacity block names
the exact full epoch, shows `64 / 64`, repeats the range, and states that the
limit is system-wide rather than a per-user quota.

Wallet and network failures take priority, followed by blacklist, weight,
cooldown, and shared capacity. The review may show every relevant fact even when
one primary reason controls the action.

### DAO-FR-030: forum discussion

The app requires a public `gov.yearn.fi` topic in the configured forum
`Proposals` category. A same-origin server endpoint validates and normalizes the
topic to the exact `/t/<slug>/<id>` URL without a trailing slash, query,
fragment, port, ambiguous path, or terminal bare `?` or `#` delimiter. The
original serialized URL must equal `${url.origin}${url.pathname}` exactly.
Eligibility uses stable category IDs, not display labels. Descendants are
accepted only when their IDs are explicitly configured. Version 1 fixes the
authoritative root to `5 / Proposals / proposals` and permits descendants `9`,
`18`, `17`, `21`, `10`, and `29` only with exact root ancestry and metadata.
Minimum topic age and poll rules remain informational until an updated DAO policy
defines them.

Direct-contract proposals that bypass this rule still appear in history with
`No verified forum discussion`.

### DAO-FR-031: immutable content

The author supplies one Markdown document, discussion URL, and declared proposal
type. The first and only H1 is the title, the next paragraph is the summary,
and body content follows. Title, summary, AST, and attachment resolutions are
derived results and are never copied into the wire object. The editor preserves
the exact Markdown source, including whitespace, line endings, and its trailing
newline. There is one in-place `yearn.dao.proposal.v1` contract and no legacy or
compatibility parser.

Only CommonMark plus GFM tables are enabled. Raw HTML, unsupported nodes,
unsafe links, unpaired surrogates, NUL/control characters, and invalid or
ambiguous attachments fail closed with located errors. Markdown is limited to
32,768 UTF-8 bytes, 4,096 nodes, depth 32, and 1,024 table cells. Title and
summary limits count graphemes with `Intl.Segmenter`. Source bytes are bounded
before parsing; iterative validation checks every heading and work bound. A
work-limit failure exposes an empty safe AST. The only accepted image context is
one sole image in a top-level body paragraph after the summary.

The canonical content JSON uses the fixed field order and one final LF. Its
SHA-256 digest is the onchain `bytes32`; its CID is CIDv1/raw/SHA-256/Base32.
The linked forum may continue changing.

Content retrieval preserves exact bytes. The frontend checks base64/byte bounds, digest, UTF-8, JSON/content structure, safe Markdown and exact canonical bytes. A content failure leaves the onchain commitment unchanged and preserves the computed digest when available. Error details belong to the frontend; the producer need not duplicate this parser. Timestamp fields must describe real RFC 3339 instants.

An image token renders an informative attachment card, never an image-producing
element. A relative `./assets/...` target matches one exact authenticated
manifest entry; a direct `ipfs://` target contains one exact canonical raw CID
and matches one unique digest. Both derive the same suffix-free trusted gateway
URL and make no request until Open is activated. Images nested in headings,
links, emphasis, lists, quotes, tables, or mixed inline content are rejected.
SVG is never rendered inline.

### DAO-FR-032: signal

Choosing `Signal` submits an empty execution script. The review step states that
the proposal contains no executable actions.

### DAO-FR-033: executable script input

Choosing `Executable` reveals one multiline input for the full hex-encoded
Executor script. The app does not require a secondary bundle format.

### DAO-FR-034: browser script checks

Before submission, the browser validates hex syntax, framing, declared lengths,
call count, total bytes, and script hash. It shows call targets and calldata
sizes. A successful result says `Script structure is valid`; it never says
`Safe` or `Verified`.

### DAO-FR-035: final review

The final confirmation uses the same validated AST renderer as Preview and
detail. It shows:

- normalized forum topic;
- exact immutable proposal content;
- proposal type;
- exact script and hash;
- call count and byte count;
- current proposer weight and cooldown eligibility;
- expected voting epoch;
- publication and transaction steps.

The review states that two separate actions are required. Step 2 stays visibly
upcoming and unavailable until immutable content is published, and publication
copy distinguishes public content publication from the later wallet-authorized onchain proposal transaction. Publication requests no wallet signature. After publication,
Step 1 retains its fingerprint receipt and focus moves to a distinct current
Step 2 surface. When the transaction hash is known, View transaction appears
before any proposal action. A successful receipt must bind the exact expected
Voting address, transaction hash, proposer, voting epoch, content digest, and
script to exactly one matching `Propose` log, and the receipt sender must equal
the Propose proposer. That log must have four canonical
topics, and its decoded topics and non-indexed data must re-encode byte for byte
with no trailing or dirty padding. Open proposal and Copy link appear only after
that receipt supplies the composite identity. Receipt confirmation,
awaiting-index, and indexed states retain the same identity. Publication failure
never exposes Step 2. The typed review outcome controls proposal creation.
Failures before wallet submission produce no transaction hash or proposal identity.
Once the wallet returns a hash, temporary network or receipt failures retain that hash.
Creation and ordinary actions retry confirmation without another wallet submission, including after reload.
A successful fee replacement must consume the same nonce and preserve the exact intended call.
Receipt decoding, recovery and indexing use the verified mined hash.
A cancellation, changed call or canonical revert is a terminal outcome with its known transaction link.
These outcomes preserve published content and require an explicit new action to retry.
Only a successful matching Propose receipt supplies an accepted proposal identity. Registration applies its delay before persistence. An indexing delay
shows `Retry indexing`, which re-registers and indexes the same receipt-derived
reference without duplicate records or events.

Publication requires a separate default-off server gate and durable global admission against configured content and attempt budgets.
Enabling DAO reads alone must not enable uploads. Admission metadata stays outside the canonical proposal document.
The server must reject invalid and over-budget content before forum or publication requests.
Authors need no provider account, publication signature, or per-document operator approval.
The durable ledger must preserve canonical bytes, spent allowances, and recoverable reservations across replicas and restarts.
Verified content must be reused without another provider request. Ambiguous uploads and gateway retries must have finite durable allowances.
See [publication operations](pinata-publication.md) for the selected Pinata path and exact accounting.

### DAO-FR-036: bounded optional content retrieval

The producer may supply exact raw content bytes as bounded base64 enrichment. The frontend reuses the existing canonical-content, Markdown and attachment parser. Null content means unavailable; malformed or digest-mismatched bytes produce a local invalid state. Do not require Rust to reproduce frontend parsing or error precedence. Missing enrichment never blocks core feed publication, unrelated proposals or protocol-permitted voting.

### DAO-FR-037: historical simulation removed from launch

No proposal-time conditional execution simulation is required. Remove historical frames, commitments, authorization/replay proofs, engine manifests, pending jobs and unavailable-analysis objects. Optional future analysis must not hold feed production or rendering hostage. Post-creation “Awaiting proposal indexing” refers to record acquisition only. Fresh simulation of the actual transaction remains mandatory for later signing flows, especially Voting.execute.

## 8. Lifecycle actions

### DAO-FR-040: retract

Show retraction only to the proposer when the client reports it is permitted.
Explain that a proposal with a positive last-write-per-account running vote
total cannot be retracted, that zero-weight Vote history does not block it, and
that retraction does not reset the proposal cooldown.

### DAO-FR-041: flag

The operator may flag only when the client reports it is permitted. The form
requires a reason within the contract limit. The same zero running-total rule
applies, including accepted zero-weight Vote history. Flagging is presented as
invalid or spam moderation, not an ordinary vote outcome.

### DAO-FR-042: veto

The guardian may veto only when the client reports it is permitted. The form
requires a reason. The confirmation explains whether the proposal has a
positive running vote total and whether participation voting will remain open.

### DAO-FR-043: execute

An executable proposal enables execution only when:

- the execution epoch and delay permit it;
- the proposal passed and is not vetoed, retracted, or executed;
- the account satisfies guard mode;
- the exact event script is available;
- its hash matches the stored script hash;
- a fresh simulation of actual Voting.execute with actual caller and exact arguments succeeds; failed or unavailable simulation blocks the normal path, and success is only preflight.

The transaction uses the shared `useTx` pipeline. One call failure reverts the
whole script.

### DAO-FR-044: live capabilities and prepared-state invalidation

The feed supplies snapshot state, not authoritative action permissions. Live wallet reads use one coherent canonical observation for the selected chain, trusted deployment, proposal and account. Show their observation separately; never relabel older feed facts as current.

Before any production signature, obtain fresh current eligibility, roles, contribution state, timing/configuration, immutable commitments and action-specific checks with exact transaction data. A stale, failed or unavailable required read/simulation blocks preparation. A successful execution preflight must carry a valid simulation block number/hash/timestamp matching the current live preparation observation and its relevant proposal/account/configuration inputs. Missing observation data or canonical replacement at the same height invalidates it; a recent simulatedAt value alone is insufficient. Bind to the live preparation context, never the older feed observation. Invalidate prepared state when account, network, proposal, script or relevant observations/configuration change. Keep writes in domain clients and shared useTx. This reset implements read overlays and preserves mock writes; it does not enable production writes.

## 9. Content and execution failure policy

| Condition | Voting | Execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content and script verified | Normal | Normal when eligible |
| IPFS unavailable | Allowed with warning | Allowed only with exact hash-valid event script |
| Content schema or digest invalid | Allowed with strong warning | Same exact-script rule |
| Event script unavailable | Allowed | Unavailable because the transaction cannot be built |
| Script hash mismatch or malformed supported framing | Allowed with warning | Blocked |
| Veto with stored retracted=false | Participation vote when live conditions permit | Blocked |
| Veto with stored retracted=true | Blocked by contract | Blocked |

The UI never submits a mismatched script. It does not turn a gateway outage into
a voting veto.

## 10. Data and trust boundaries

Use the [V2 contract](feed-schema-v2.md) and [field/source mapping](feed-v2-field-sources.md). The producer is an operator cache, not a trustless proof. State comes from coherent block-pinned view calls; history supplies original scripts, chronology and event-only facts. Scan inclusively from deployment. Refresh all proposals at every snapshot, without historical state replay, traces or storage reconstruction.

The app owns trusted chain/deployment configuration. One static snapshot contains complete configured proposal/log coverage. Bound payloads and requests; never silently omit proposals or history. Optional content may be null. Distinguish snapshot age, current wallet observations, stale/last-good data and confirmed-write feed lag.

## 11. Runtime and rollout

Production DAO exposure remains feature-gated. Production selects the V2 consumer and live domain clients, never mocks.
Reviewed wallet actions use fresh canonical reads, exact-call simulation, and the shared transaction pipeline.
Mock/debug actions stay in nonproduction runtime. Invalid deployment configuration surfaces an error without choosing transaction destinations.

Consumer completion precedes external review, explicit producer-start approval, producer implementation, actual-byte interoperability and lifecycle gates, then production approval. The prior V1 freeze and producer-before-consumer dependency are superseded. Historical acceptance remains recorded. V2 may receive coordinated amendments after producer evidence.

Shared-host validation at `app.dao-ops.com/dao` precedes manual dashboard configuration of `dao.yearn.fi`.
The approved production launch enables DAO reads, wallet actions, and publication. Protected beta access and noindex policies remain unchanged.
Use the [production procedure](production-release.md) for configuration and release order.

## 12. Quality requirements

- All controls are keyboard accessible and have at least a 40 by 40 pixel hit
  area, with 44 pixels used where practical.
- Status is never communicated by color alone.
- Headings balance cleanly; body copy avoids orphaned words where supported.
- Timers and changing weights use tabular numerals.
- Mobile layouts preserve readable scripts, addresses, and vote controls without
  horizontal page overflow.
- Long Markdown headings and links wrap; tables, fenced code, and exact source
  scroll inside their own labelled regions at 390, 768, and 1,280 pixels and at
  200% root text.
- Attachment cards contain no image-producing element, preload, metadata probe,
  or automatic request. Only user-activated Open navigates to the validated raw
  CID URL.
- Write/Preview tabs use native tab semantics and keyboard navigation. A located
  validation error returns to Write, focuses the textarea, and selects the
  deterministic UTF-16 caret offset.
- Authoring uses one polite atomic live region for asynchronous progress.
- The resolved application label is a native host-aware home link: `/` on its
  branded beta host and the exact app path on shared hosts. It keeps visible
  focus and a 40-pixel desktop or 44-pixel mobile target.
- No component calls raw wagmi writes.
- Tests cover every capability/status mismatch, especially vetoed-but-votable.
