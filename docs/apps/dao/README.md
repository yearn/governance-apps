# DAO Governance

Publication acceptance completed on 23 September 2026. The operator reports preprod deployed with two successful proposals.
Production launch includes reads, wallet actions, and publication. Independent candidate review precedes operator deployment.
The [acceptance record](publication-acceptance-20260923.md) separates checked artifacts, operator observations, and historical limitations.
The [closeout evidence](delivery/evidence/closeout-20260924/README.md) covers subsequent corrections and offline validation.

| Purpose | Current entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture, transaction checks, and recovery | [Live services](live-services.md) |
| Built local walkthrough and real producer snapshots | [Local validation](local-validation.md) |
| Ordered production release and private operator inputs | [Production procedure](production-release.md) |
| Preprod status, shared infrastructure, and historical preparation | [Preprod reference](preprod-validation.md) |
| Publication configuration, budgets, backup, and rollback | [Publication operations](pinata-publication.md) |
| Development, file-based D1 setup, and regression commands | [Local development](local-development.md) and [disposable fork UAT](local-fork-uat.md) |
| Accepted validation and remaining release work | [Acceptance](publication-acceptance-20260923.md), [release checklist](release-checklist.md), and [delivery status](delivery/status.md) |
| Dated plans, failed attempts, and evidence locations | [Historical index](delivery/historical-index.md) |

The current candidate lives on `agent/integration`. The [production handoff](delivery/production-release-20261001.md) records its review range and validation.
The earlier approved publication package is `da041f5eaa5abe55ed5221f2642d3f0b047e5315`.
The [integration record](delivery/integration-20260924.md) identifies the merge, added tooling, validation, and remaining release inputs.
Provider selection and live publication acceptance are closed. The completed A/C/B procedures are historical material.

## Product and trust boundaries

Global reads use one static cache of coherent contract state and canonical event history. The producer refreshes all proposals at each snapshot. The frontend derives display groups, status labels, percentages, content validity and supported script framing. Current wallet facts come from a separately dated live observation.

Proposal identity includes chain, Voting address and uint256 ID, including zero. The app explicitly configures supported deployments. It never accepts a transaction destination or RPC endpoint chosen by a feed.

Stored proposal thresholds and snapshot-effective configuration have distinct labels. There is no quorum: percentages say “of votes cast”; passing still requires positive total weight and the contract's integer arithmetic. Flag/Veto have unknown historical actors unless the event itself identifies one. Vetoed, nonretracted proposals may remain votable. Signal completion never invents an Execute transaction.

The immutable format stays `yearn.dao.proposal.v1`. Canonical bytes, digest/CID commitments, safe Markdown and no-load attachment cards remain intact. Content failure does not hide a proposal or prohibit otherwise valid voting. Original script bytes and stored hash stay visible; missing/mismatched/malformed supported scripts block execution preparation. Historical simulations, build proofs, trace attribution and precise human voter counts are outside launch.

Writes stay in domain clients and shared useTx. Authoring separates content publication, receipt-confirmed creation, and awaiting-index recovery. The combined implementation retains fresh actual-call preflight before signing.

## Routes and rollout

Shared hosts use `/dao`, `/dao/proposals/[id]`, and `/dao/propose`. Proposal links carry chain/Voting selection where needed.
The existing internal `dao-beta.dao-ops.com` host stays protected, unlisted, noindex, and noncanonical.
The operator configures `dao.yearn.fi` manually after validation at `app.dao-ops.com/dao`. Wrangler retains only the existing production route.
Forum discussion remains at `gov.yearn.fi`.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DAO` gates production routes. `DAO_PUBLICATION_ENABLED` independently gates uploads, which require configured Pinata secrets and durable global admission.
Both values are `true` for the approved production launch. Publication disablement remains available during an incident.
Authors need no publication signature or document approval. Production mode has no mock fallback, including on the beta host.
Protected preview environments can review mock actions. See the [production procedure](production-release.md) for the release configuration.
