# `user-stories-styfi.md`

**User Stories — stYFI & stYFIx**
**Version:** 1.3
**Scope:** Part I of the Governance Apps (stYFI + stYFIx)

---

# 1. Purpose

These user stories define **what users must be able to do** in the `/styfi` section of the governance app.
They describe desired behaviour **from the user’s point of view**, without dictating implementation details.

These stories inform the FE Functional Requirements and the Architecture Blueprint.

---

# 2. Personas

We assume a technically literate DeFi user familiar with:

- Ethereum wallet connections
- Transaction signing
- Staking/cooldown mechanics
- ERC-4626 vault share semantics (but still requiring explicit UI clarity)

---

# 3. User Stories (stYFI)

---

## Story ST-00 — Smart Onboarding (Mode Selection)

**As a** user connecting their wallet
**I want** the app to automatically detect my existing position
**So that** I don't have to manually select between "stYFI" and "stYFIx" every time

### Acceptance Criteria

- **New User (0 Balance):** Show the Mode Selection Drawer (Expanded) to educate them on the options.
- **Returning User (Has Balance):** Automatically select the mode where I have the highest balance and collapse the drawer.
- **Persistence:** Remember my last selection if I have no balance but have visited before.

## Story ST-03 — Understand stYFI Reward Accrual Windows

**As a** stYFI user
**I want** to clearly understand the difference between accruing and claimable rewards
**So that** I know what to expect after staking

### Acceptance Criteria

- UI distinguishes:

  - accruing rewards (within 7-epoch collection window)
  - claimable rewards (within payout window)

- Newly staked positions show **0 claimable** until eligible
- No speculative or projected reward values

---

## Story ST-05 — Start/Reset Cooldown for stYFI

**As a** stYFI user
**I want** to start or add to a cooldown
**So that** I can eventually withdraw my YFI

### Acceptance Criteria

- Only visible when user has stYFI staked.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Input is hidden behind a "+ Unstake more" button if a cooldown is already active.
- **Partial Resets & Auto-Claim:** If I add to an existing cooldown:
  - I am explicitly warned that the 14-day timer will **reset** for the remaining stream.
  - Any funds currently **liquid** (available) from the stream are **automatically claimed** to my `Exited` (unlocked) balance to prevent re-locking them.
- Shows cooldown end timestamp.

---

## Story ST-06 — Monitor & Withdraw YFI (Linear Streaming)

**As a** stYFI user in cooldown
**I want** to see my funds unlocking over time and withdraw them as they become available
**So that** I don't have to wait for the full 14 days to access some liquidity

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Unified Tab:** Withdraw logic lives in the same tab as Cooldown logic ("Unstake").
- **Progress Bar:** Visualizes the ratio of Liquid vs. Streaming funds (Orange/Brand color).
- **Linear Access:** Withdraw button enabled as soon as `Liquid > 0` OR `Exited > 0`.
- **Clarity:** UI distinguishes between:
  - "Available to Withdraw" (Liquid + Exited)
  - "Streaming" (Still locked, with time remaining)
- After withdrawal success:
  - Liquid/Exited amount reduces/zeros
  - Wallet balance increases
  - Streaming portion continues unaffected

# 6. Non-Goals (for `/styfi`, Part I)

These stories explicitly **not** part of this domain:

- veYFI migration
- LLYFI flows
- Redemption caps
- Governance voting
- Voting power decay visuals
- YBC-specific behaviour
- Historical metrics / analytics
- Transfer UI

---

# 7. Versioning Notes

- This user-story set reflects the frontend behaviour required for BR#1.
- Changes to protocol or FE FRD MUST update this file.
- All stories map 1:1 to FRD sections.
- Cooldown handling uses a shared cross-domain primitive (CooldownState), consistent between stYFI, stYFIx, and LLYFI flows.
